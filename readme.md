## Why the Move?

This plugin was originally created to hide the **Cash on Delivery (COD)** payment option for specific cities in Morocco. It has now evolved into a more flexible and global solution that supports:

- City-based restrictions (worldwide)
- Country-based exclusions
- Order total conditions
- And more to come...
